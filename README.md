# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Movies to Watch 2.0 by Jiale Hou

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of *Movies to Watch*.


# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
...  
I spend 7 days(40 hours) to complete entire project.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I was very satisfied with my kivy GUI, because the coding process was very smooth and final result looks very nice too.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
That will be the task 3, when I'm trying to apply my moviecollection and movie py for A1. I spend a lot of time to make 
 it work, and I have to fix many errors.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
The coding process for kivy GUI.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I think I need to review what I have learned early on in python class. Because during the coding process, I forgot many
techniques or rules in python. That cost a lot of time to fix the error. 

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I was using lecture note, lecture recording, PPT and weekly practical work for learning resources. Mostly I was using 
weekly practical work; because there are many good code I can apply in my assignment. So I find similar practical work
for each small section in my assignment, I can review this code and logic then use it for my assignment.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The main challenge is me keep forgetting things I have learned previously. So, I have to review what I have learned
in class before to keep my knowledge fresh in me. That's how I overcome this obstacle.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
I was not enjoy using it at first place. However, after I got familiar with them, they are very helpful to me.
That save a lot of time for, also I do not have to code similar function or code over and over again. Lastly, they made
my whole program looks easier and cleaner.
